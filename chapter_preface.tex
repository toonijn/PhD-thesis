\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

A thesis is a work of long breath\footnote{This is a literal translation of the Dutch expression: `\foreignlanguage{dutch}{Een werk van lange adem}'.}. In the past five years, I have worked on this project. In this book you can find my process in learning about and contributing to the numerical study of Schr√∂dinger equations.

This thesis is written from quite a technical perspective and is definitely not suited as an introductory text to the subject. Following along will require quite a lot of background knowledge. The text assumes you are already familiar with (partial) differential equations, numerical methods for solving these and the intricacies when implementing them. So, if you want to know \emph{all} advances written in this work, then trying to read the book cover to cover may be the best way. I tried to logically structure the work with sufficient cross-references and citation.

If however you are still interested in reading this book without a deep technical knowledge, then I recommend skipping the more technical discussions. Starting with the summary will provide you with a basic overview about what you can expect from this work. Chapter~\ref{cha:c1} gives some historical context about mathematical evolution and in particular about the conception of differential equations. Chapters~\ref{cha:c2},~\ref{cha:c3} and~\ref{cha:c4} contain the innovations from this thesis. Each of these chapters starts with some historical background and mathematical motivation, and ends with some numerical experiments to evaluate the performance (both in accuracy as efficiency) of our methods. For simply a cursory examination of my research, these sections may be sufficient.

If still, you are interested in this thesis, however not so much in the mathematics, even then I can provide some guidance on how to read it. I assume you are more interested in doing research in general or even in me personally. In this case you may\footnote{Of course, as the owner of a book you can read it however you want (or even burn it). So, not that you need it, but you definitely have my permission to skip (large) parts, if they are not of interest to you.} just skip chapters~\ref{cha:c2},~\ref{cha:c3} and~\ref{cha:c4} entirely. The summary and chapter~\ref{cha:c1} may provide sufficient context. For some personal notes, I recommend taking a look at the closing remarks at the end of this work as well.

In the introductory paragraph I stated that this research came into fruition within the past five years. In the most literal sense, this is of course true. Practically however, doing research is quite an individual pursuit, and as such it is quite a personal one. Each researcher is different and experiences the world around them uniquely. This difference, in part, relies on the background of the (mathematical) education of the researcher. In my case, I think I can say that my `mathematical career' started a good fifteen years ago. My interest in and passion for mathematics become abundantly clear\footnote{To the detriment of the non-science courses.} throughout high school. My mathematical adventure really took off when I started at Ghent University, now, ten years later, I can close this chapter with the completion of a PhD in mathematics.

\section*{Closing the opening words}

To end this section there is still one person left to thank, and that is you: the reader. Writing this book has been quite the adventure, and I hope reading it will give you a sincere view on the whole affair.


If you have any questions, remarks or comments (about this work, or even more generally about me), I am very eager to hear them. Please do reach out!

Finally, I wish you the very best of luck in reading this thesis.
