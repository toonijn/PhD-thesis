The treatment relies heavily on the convergence properties of sequences and series of numbers as well as functions, and assumes a solid background in advanced calculus and an acquaintance with ordinary differential equations and linear algebra. Familiarity with the relevant theorems of real analysis, such as the Ascoli\textendash Arzel\`a theorem, is also useful for following the proofs. The presentation follows a clear and rigorous mathematical style that is both readable and well motivated, with many examples and applications used to illustrate the theory. Although addressed primarily to undergraduate students of mathematics, the book will also be of interest to students in related disciplines, such as physics and engineering, where Fourier analysis and special functions are used extensively for solving linear differential equations.},

  abstract = {Differential equations have been a major branch of pure and applied mathematics since their inauguration in the mid 17th century. While their history has been well studied, it remains a vital field of on-going investigation, with the emergence of new connections with other parts of mathematics, fertile interplay with applied subjects, interesting reformulation of basic problems and theory in various periods, new vistas in the 20th century, and so on. In this meeting we considered some of the principal parts of this story, from the launch with Newton and Leibniz up to around 1950. \textbackslash `Differential equations' began with Leibniz, the Bernoulli brothers and others from the 1680s, not long after Newton's \textbackslash `fluxional equations' in the 1670s. Applications were made largely to geometry and mechanics; isoperimetrical problems were exercises in optimisation. Most 18th-century developments consolidated the Leibnizian tradition, extending its multi-variate form, thus leading to partial differential equations. Generalisation of isoperimetrical problems led to the calculus of variations. New figures appeared, especially Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Lagrange and Laplace. Development of the general theory of solutions included singular ones, functional solutions and those by infinite series. Many applications were made to mechanics, especially to astronomy and continuous media. In the 19th century: general theory was enriched by development of the understanding of general and particular solutions, and of existence theorems. More types of equation and their solutions appeared; for example, Fourier analysis and special functions. Among new figures, Cauchy stands out. Applications were now made not only to classical mechanics but also to heat theory, optics, electricity and magnetism, especially with the impact of Maxwell. Later Poincar\textbackslash\textbackslash 'e introduced recurrence theorems, initially in connection with the three-body problem. In the 20th century: general theory was influenced by the arrival of set theory in mathematical analysis; with consequences for theorisation, including further topological aspects. New applications were made to quantum mathematics, dynamical systems and relativity theory.},

The numerical examples show that speed up factors up to 20 (for the eigenvalues) and 200 (for the eigenfunctions) are obtained.

These languages are two well known examples of high-level scripting languages that promise to increase productivity without compromising performance on HPC systems. In this paper, we report our work and experience with these two non-traditional programming languages at the HPCMP Centers. We used a representative sample of SIP codes for the study, with special emphasis given to the understanding of issues such as portability, degree of complexity, productivity and suitability of Octave and Python to address signal/image processing (SIP) problems on the HPCMP HPC platforms. We implemented a relatively simple two-dimensional (2D) FFT and a more complex image enhancement algorithm in Octave and Python and benchmarked these SIP codes on several HPCMP platforms, paying special attention to usability, productivity and performance aspects. Moreover, we performed a thorough benchmark containing important low level SIP core functions and algorithms and compared the outcome with the corresponding results for MATLAB. We found that the capabilities of these languages are comparable to MATLAB and they are powerful enough to efficiently implement complex SIP algorithms. Productivity and performance results for each language vary depending on the specific task and the availability of high level functions in each system to address such tasks. Therefore, the choice of the best language to use in a particular instance will strongly depend upon the specifics of the SIP application that needs to be addressed. We concluded that Octave and Python look like promising tools that may provide an alternative to MATLAB without compromising performance and productivity. Their syntax and functionality are similar enough to MATLAB to present a very shallow learning curve for experienced MATLAB users},

Within each frontal matrix, LAPACK and the multithreaded BLAS enable the method to obtain high performance on multicore architectures. Parallelism across different frontal matrices is handled with Intel's Threading Building Blocks library. The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [R11 R12; 0 A22] where R11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of ATA. Approximate rank-detection is performed within each frontal matrix using Heath's method. While Heath's method is not always exact, it has the advantage of not requiring column pivoting and thus does not interfere with the fill-reducing ordering. For sufficiently large problems, the resulting sparse QR factorization obtains a substantial fraction of the theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.},

Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.},

The singular value decomposition (SVD) is explored as the common structure in the three basic algorithms: direct matrix pencil algorithm, pro-ESPRIT, and TLS-ESPRIT. It is shown that several SVD-based steps inherent in the algorithms are equivalent to the first-order approximation. In particular, the Pro-ESPRIT and its variant TLS-Pro-ESPRIT are shown to be equivalent, and the TLS-ESPRIT and its earlier version LS-ESPRIT are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the first-order approximation. For the problem of estimating superimposed complex exponential signals, the state-space algorithm is shown to be also equivalent to the previous matrix pencil algorithms to the first-order approximation. The second-order perturbation and the threshold phenomenon are illustrated by simulation results based on a damped sinusoidal signal. An improved state-space algorithm is found to be the most robust to noise.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The standard monograph in this area is the book Exponential fitting by Ixaru and Vanden Berghe (Kluwer, Boston - Dordrecht - London, 2004) but a fresh look on things is necessary because many new contributions have been accumulated in the meantime. With no claim that our investigation is exhaustive we consider various directions of interest, try to integrate the new contributions in a natural, easy to follow way, and also detect some open problems of acute interest. We present the extension of the successful Constant Perturbation Method (CPM) for Schr\"odinger problems to the more general class of Sturm\textendash Liouville eigenvalue problems. Whereas the original CPM can only be applied to Sturm\textendash Liouville problems after a Liouville transformation, the more general CPM presented here solves the Sturm\textendash Liouville problem directly. This enlarges the range of applicability of the CPM to a wider variety of problems and allows a more efficient solution of many problems. The CPMs are closely related to the second-order coefficient approximation method underlying the SLEDGE software package, but provide for higher order approximations. These higher order approximations can also be obtained by applying a modified Neumann method. The CPM approach, however, leads to simpler formulae in a more convenient form. Finding the eigenvalues of a Sturm\textendash Liouville problem can be a computationally challenging task, especially when a large set of eigenvalues is computed, or just when particularly large eigenvalues are sought. This is a consequence of the highly oscillatory behavior of the solutions corresponding to high eigenvalues, which forces a naive integrator to take increasingly smaller steps. We will discuss the most used approaches to the numerical solution of the Sturm\textendash Liouville problem: finite differences and variational methods, both leading to a matrix eigenvalue problem; shooting methods using an initial-value solver; and coefficient approximation methods. Special attention will be paid to techniques that yield uniform approximation over the whole eigenvalue spectrum and that allow large steps even for high eigenvalues. The paper is devoted to the enhancement of the accuracy of the line-based perturbation method via the introduction of the perturbation corrections. We effectively construct the first and the second order corrections. We also perform the error analysis to predict that the introduction of successive corrections substantially enhances the order of the method from four, for the zeroth order version, to six and ten when the first and the second-order corrections are included. In order to remove the effect of the accuracy loss due to near-cancellation of like-terms when evaluating the perturbation corrections we construct alternative asymptotic formulae using a Maple code. We also propose a procedure for choosing the step size in terms of the preset accuracy and give a number of numerical illustrations. After a short survey over the efforts in the direction of solving the Schr\"odinger equation by using piecewise approximations of the potential function, the paper focuses on the piecewise perturbation methods in their CP implementation. The presentation includes a short list of problems for which CP versions are available, a sketch of the derivation of the CPM formulae, a description of various ways to construct or identify a certain version and also the main results of the error analysis. One of the most relevant results of the latter is that the energy dependence of the error is bounded, a fact which places these methods on a special position among the numerical methods for differential equations. A numerical illustration is also included in which a CPM based code for the regular Sturm\textendash Liouville problem is compared with some other, well-established codes.

  abstract = {The standard monograph in this area is the book Exponential fitting by Ixaru and Vanden Berghe (Kluwer, Boston - Dordrecht - London, 2004) but a fresh look on things is necessary because many new contributions have been accumulated in the meantime. With no claim that our investigation is exhaustive we consider various directions of interest, try to integrate the new contributions in a natural, easy to follow way, and also detect some open problems of acute interest. The paper is devoted to the enhancement of the accuracy of the line-based perturbation method via the introduction of the perturbation corrections. We effectively construct the first and the second order corrections. We also perform the error analysis to predict that the introduction of successive corrections substantially enhances the order of the method from four, for the zeroth order version, to six and ten when the first and the second-order corrections are included. In order to remove the effect of the accuracy loss due to near-cancellation of like-terms when evaluating the perturbation corrections we construct alternative asymptotic formulae using a Maple code. We also propose a procedure for choosing the step size in terms of the preset accuracy and give a number of numerical illustrations. We propose a method for the construction of potential energy curves of diatomic molecules from spectroscopic data. It is based on perturbation theory and an appropriate numerical integration algorithm and corrects the potential energy function iteratively until the eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger equation agree with the experimental energies. The method is stable and converges fast enough to allow one to adjust many potential parameters. We choose the eigenvalues of the Kratzer oscillator as experimental data to test both the performance of the method and the accuracy of the Dunham expansion about equilibrium. The Dunham expansion obtained from the spectrum has a range of utility which is remarkably larger than the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion about equilibrium. We also apply the present method to the ground electronic state of the CO molecule and show that the Dunham expansion agrees with the RKR turning points. We discuss further applications of the method. A method is proposed for obtaining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation. The eigenvalue problem is transformed into a system of two first-order ordinary linear differential equations. The propagation matrix for the solution is written as the exponential of a traceless matrix which is then approximated by the Magnus expansion. The bound-state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by requiring that the latter satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. The Morse potential is considered as an illustrative example. A new four-step exponentially-fitted method is developed in this paper. The expressions for the coefficients of the method are found such as to ensure the optimal approximation to the eigenvalue Schr\"odinger equation (i.e., equivalent to positive energy). In this paper, we focus our attention on deriving and analyzing an efficient energy-preserving formula for the system of nonlinear oscillatory or highly oscillatory second-order differential equations q{${''}$}(t)+Mq(t)=fq(t){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>{''}<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}+{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi mathvariant="italic" is="true"{$>$}Mq{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}f{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close=")" open="(" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, where M is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix with M{$\gg$}1{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\gg<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and f(q)=-{$\nabla$}qU(q){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}f{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}-{$<$}/mo{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\nabla<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} is the negative gradient of a real-valued function U(q){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.

The energy-preserving formula exactly preserves the Hamiltonian. We analyze in detail the properties of the energy-preserving formula and propose new efficient energy-preserving integrators in the sense of numerical implementation. The convergence analysis of the fixed-point iteration is presented for the implicit integrators proposed in this paper. It is shown that the convergence of implicit Average Vector Field methods is dependent on M{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, whereas the convergence of the new energy-preserving integrators is independent of M{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}. The Fermi\textendash Pasta\textendash Ulam problem and the sine\textendash Gordon equation are carried out numerically to show the competence and efficiency of the novel integrators in comparison with the well-known Average Vector Field methods in the scientific literature. The energy preserving average vector field (AVF) integrator is applied to evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) in bi-Hamiltonian form with nonconstant Poisson structures. Numerical results for the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation and for the Ito type coupled KdV equation confirm the long term preservation of the Hamiltonians and Casimir integrals, which is essential in simulating waves and solitons. Dispersive properties of the AVF integrator are investigated for the linearized equations to examine the nonlinear dynamics after discretization. This paper presents the underlying theory, associated mathematical modelling and analysis of a sponge-layer damping technique, termed the Time-Reversal-Sponge-Layer (TRSL), that significantly improves the performance of aeroacoustic Time-Reversal (TR). The TR technique requires the use of multiple Line Arrays (LAs) in a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM) to accurately predict the source location and its characteristics. However, it is shown that when using multiple LAs, the interference between the opposite propagating fluxes near the LA boundaries results in the formation of spurious local maxima regions throughout the computational domain, thereby reducing the capacity of TR to resolve acoustic sources. The novel TRSL technique proposed in this work minimises this unwanted interference by damping the flux normally incident on a LA boundary and is implemented using the Pseudo-Characteristic Formulation (PCF) of the two-dimensional Linearised Euler Equations (LEE). The performance of TRSL is assessed by simulating a number of test cases such as an idealised time-harmonic monopole, dipole and lateral quadrupole sources as well as multiple (two) dipole sources of different strengths located in a nonuniform mean shear flow. The use of TRSL suppresses the formation of spurious maxima and significantly improves the source map, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of this damping technique. The performance of TRSL is compared with two other methods: a TR superposition technique and Conventional Beamforming (CB). The TR superposition technique prevents the flux interference problem near the LA boundaries by superposing the instantaneous time-reversed acoustic pressure fields computed from individual LAs. The source map obtained using the superposition technique was found to be identical to that obtained using the TRSL damping technique, however, the computational cost was much higher. A comparison with CB indicated that although CB accurately predicts the aeroacoustic source location, the relative magnitudes of the side-lobes in the CB source map(s) are substantially higher in comparison to the corresponding TR source map(s). It was also shown that TR with use of the TRSL is better suited for resolving multiple coherent sources in a domain than the CB method, especially when one source is much weaker than other sources in the domain. We report some special solutions of biconfluent Heun equation and triconfluent Heun equation via extended Nikiforov\textendash Uvarov (NU) method which is developed by changing the boundary conditions of NU method [8]. We demonstrate that eigenvalue solutions of these confluent forms of Heun equation can be achieved exactly. Furthermore we give eigenvalue solution of a two-electron quantum dot model problem as a physical application of extended NU method. In this paper, we consider a class of coupled systems of PDEs, denoted by (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}. For each {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, the system (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} consists of an Allen\textendash Cahn type equation in a bounded spacial domain {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, and another Allen\textendash Cahn type equation on the smooth boundary {$\Gamma$}:={$\partial\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Gamma<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}:{$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\partial<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, and besides, these coupled equations are transmitted via the dynamic boundary conditions. In particular, the equation in {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} is derived from the non-smooth energy proposed by Visintin in his monography ``Models of phase transitions'': hence, the diffusion in {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} is provided by a quasilinear form with singularity. The objective of this paper is to build a mathematical method to obtain meaningful L2{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}L{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}-based solutions to our systems, and to see some robustness of (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} with respect to {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}. On this basis, we will prove two Main Theorems 1 and 2, which will be concerned with the well-posedness of (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for each {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, and the continuous dependence of solutions to (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for the variations of {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, respectively. American put option pricing under regime switching is modelled by a system of coupled partial differential equations. The proposed model combines better the reality of the market by incorporating the regime switching jointly with the emotional behaviour of traders using the rationality parameter approach recently introduced by T\aa gholt Gad and Lund Petersen to cope with possible irrational exercise policy. The classical rational exercise is recovered as a limit case of the rational parameter. The resulting nonlinear system of PDEs is solved by a weighted finite difference method, also known as \texttheta{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\theta <$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-method. In order to avoid the need of an iterative method for nonlinear system, the term with rationality parameter and the coupling term are treated explicitly. Next, the resulting linear system is solved by Thomas algorithm. Stability conditions for the numerical scheme are studied by using von Neumann approach. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

While the former has received a great deal of attention in the literature, the latter is seldom analyzed and is typically borrowed without justification from the PCA context. In this work, we demonstrate that the standard PCA deflation procedure is seldom appropriate for the sparse PCA setting. To rectify the situation, we first develop several deflation alternatives better suited to the cardinality-constrained context. We then reformulate the sparse PCA optimization problem to explicitly reflect the maximum additional variance objective on each round. The result is a generalized deflation procedure that typically outperforms more standard techniques on real-world datasets.},

The task is to compute the value of the definite integral of a given function. This is the area under a curve in one dimension or a volume in several dimensions. In addition to being a problem of great practi\- cal interest it has also lead to the development of mathematics of much beauty and insight. Many portions of approximation theory are directly applicable to integration and results from areas as diverse as orthogo\- nal polynomials, Fourier series and number theory have had important implications for the evaluation of integrals. We denote the problem addressed here as numerical integration or numerical quadrature. Over the years analysts and engineers have contributed to a growing body of theorems, algorithms and lately, programs, for the solution of this specific problem. Much effort has been devoted to techniques for the analytic evalua\- tion of integrals. However, most routine integrals in practical scien\- tific work are incapable of being evaluated in closed form. Even if an expression can be derived for the value of an integral, often this reveals itself only after inordinate amounts of error prone algebraic manipulation. Recently some computer procedures have been developed which can perform analytic integration when it is possible.},

We describe a Fortran implementation and the considerations that went into its design. A novel feature is that (almost) all the code defining one problem is textually contiguous in the Fortran text, unlike for example the DETEST package for ODE initial-value solvers where the definition of a problem is spread over several routines. The described implementation forms the infrastructure of the SLDRVER interactive package which supports exploration of a set of Sturm-Liouville problems with the four SL-solvers SLEIGN, SLEDGE, SL02F, and SLEIGN2. A ``standard'' set of 60 problems is provided, but it is simple to replace this by another one.},

Consequently, the desire to understand the solutions of these equations has always had a prominent place in the efforts of mathematicians; it has inspired such diverse fields as complex function theory, functional analysis, and algebraic topology. Like algebra, topology, and rational mechanics, PDEs are a core area of mathematics. This book aims to provide the background necessary to initiate work on a Ph.D. thesis in PDEs for beginning graduate students. Prerequisites include a truly advanced calculus course and basic complex variables. Lebesgue integration is needed only in chapter 10, and the necessary tools from functional analysis are developed within the coarse. The book can be used to teach a variety of different courses. This new edition features new problems throughout, and the problems have been rearranged in each section from simplest to most difficult. New examples have also been added. The material on Sobolev spaces has been rearranged and expanded. A new section on nonlinear variational problems with "Young-measure" solutions appears. The reference section has also been expanded.},

The scheme uses a symmetrical multi-point difference formula to represent the partial differentials of the two-dimensional variables, which can improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions to the order of {$\Delta$}x2Nq+2 when a (2Nq+1)-point formula is used for any positive integer Nq with {$\Delta$}x={$\Delta$}y, while Nq=1 equivalent to the traditional scheme. On the other hand, the new scheme keeps the same form of the traditional matrix equation so that the standard algebraic eigenvalue algorithm with a real, symmetric, large sparse matrix is still applicable. Therefore, for the same dimension, only a little more CPU time than the traditional one should be used for diagonalizing the matrix. The numerical examples of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the two-dimensional Henon\textendash Heiles potential demonstrate that by using the new method, the error in the numerical solutions can be reduced steadily and extensively through the increase of Nq, which is more efficient than the traditional methods through the decrease of the step size.},

We formulate MEFMRKN methods and show clearly the relationship between MEFMRKN methods and multidimensional extended Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om (ERKN) methods proposed by Wu et~al. (Comput. Phys. Comm. 181:1955\textendash 1962, 2010). Taking into account the fact that the oscillatory system is a separable Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian \$H(p,q)=\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}p\^\{T\}p+ \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}q\^\{T\}Mq+U(q)\$, we derive the symplecticity conditions for the MEFMRKN methods. Two explicit symplectic MEFMRKN methods are proposed. Numerical experiments accompanied demonstrate that our explicit symplectic MEFMRKN methods are more efficient than some well-known numerical methods appeared in the scientific literature.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a numerical study for the two-dimensional damped Klein\textendash Gordon equation with time fractional and nonlinear source term. The proposed scheme is based on the exponential fitting technique and gives rise to a class of fourth order or sixth order in both spatial dimensions and with the second order in time. This technique depends on a free parameter, which will be used to annihilate the error and increase the order of accuracy. The proposed method's stability and convergence are analyzed by Fourier analysis. Also, the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the numerical scheme are confirmed by numerical tests.},

  abstract = {In 1836-1837 Sturm and Liouville published a series of papers on second order linear ordinary differential operators, which started the subject now known as the Sturm-Liouville problem. In 1910 Hermann Weyl published an article which started the study of singular Sturm-Liouville problems. Since then, the Sturm-Liouville theory remains an intensely active field of research, with many applications in mathematics and mathematical physics. The purpose of the present book is (a) to provide a modern survey of some of the basic properties of Sturm-Liouville theory and (b) to bring the reader to the forefront of knowledge about some aspects of this theory. To use the book, only a basic knowledge of advanced calculus and a rudimentary knowledge of Lebesgue integration and operator theory are assumed. An extensive list of references and examples is provided and numerous open problems are given. The list of examples includes those classical equations and functions associated with the names of Bessel, Fourier, Heun, Ince, Jacobi, Jorgens, Latzko, Legendre, Littlewood-McLeod, Mathieu, Meissner, Morse, as well as examples associated with the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. Many special functions of applied mathematics and mathematical physics occur in these examples.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study is an approximate construction with a given accuracy of solutions of boundary value problems for eigenvalues under various types of boundary conditions. It is shown that the problem of finding approximate large eigenvalues of boundary value problems is reduced to the analysis and solution of singularly perturbed differential equations with variable coefficients. Methods used: asymptotic diagram method developed to construct the asymptotic behavior of solutions of singularly perturbed differential equations and systems; methods of numerical integration of boundary value problems. The main results obtained are: the asymptotics of the required accuracy are constructed in the analytical form for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the boundary value problems under various boundary conditions; analysis of the computational capabilities of the practical use of the constructed asymptotics in comparison with the results of numerical integration.},
