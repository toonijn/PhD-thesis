Matslise 3.0 currently allows the accurate, but in comparison to Matslise 2.0, faster computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger problems. The numerical examples show that speed up factors up to 20 (for the eigenvalues) and 200 (for the eigenfunctions) are obtained. These highly optimized routines will enable us, in the near future, to extend Matslise 3.0 to solve time-independent 2D and 3D as well as time-dependent 1D problems.

The singular value decomposition (SVD) is explored as the common structure in the three basic algorithms: direct matrix pencil algorithm, pro-ESPRIT, and TLS-ESPRIT. It is shown that several SVD-based steps inherent in the algorithms are equivalent to the first-order approximation. In particular, the Pro-ESPRIT and its variant TLS-Pro-ESPRIT are shown to be equivalent, and the TLS-ESPRIT and its earlier version LS-ESPRIT are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the first-order approximation. For the problem of estimating superimposed complex exponential signals, the state-space algorithm is shown to be also equivalent to the previous matrix pencil algorithms to the first-order approximation. The second-order perturbation and the threshold phenomenon are illustrated by simulation results based on a damped sinusoidal signal. An improved state-space algorithm is found to be the most robust to noise.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The standard monograph in this area is the book Exponential fitting by Ixaru and Vanden Berghe (Kluwer, Boston - Dordrecht - London, 2004) but a fresh look on things is necessary because many new contributions have been accumulated in the meantime. With no claim that our investigation is exhaustive we consider various directions of interest, try to integrate the new contributions in a natural, easy to follow way, and also detect some open problems of acute interest. We present the extension of the successful Constant Perturbation Method (CPM) for Schr\"odinger problems to the more general class of Sturm\textendash Liouville eigenvalue problems. Whereas the original CPM can only be applied to Sturm\textendash Liouville problems after a Liouville transformation, the more general CPM presented here solves the Sturm\textendash Liouville problem directly. This enlarges the range of applicability of the CPM to a wider variety of problems and allows a more efficient solution of many problems. The CPMs are closely related to the second-order coefficient approximation method underlying the SLEDGE software package, but provide for higher order approximations. These higher order approximations can also be obtained by applying a modified Neumann method. The CPM approach, however, leads to simpler formulae in a more convenient form. Finding the eigenvalues of a Sturm\textendash Liouville problem can be a computationally challenging task, especially when a large set of eigenvalues is computed, or just when particularly large eigenvalues are sought. This is a consequence of the highly oscillatory behavior of the solutions corresponding to high eigenvalues, which forces a naive integrator to take increasingly smaller steps. We will discuss the most used approaches to the numerical solution of the Sturm\textendash Liouville problem: finite differences and variational methods, both leading to a matrix eigenvalue problem; shooting methods using an initial-value solver; and coefficient approximation methods. Special attention will be paid to techniques that yield uniform approximation over the whole eigenvalue spectrum and that allow large steps even for high eigenvalues. The paper is devoted to the enhancement of the accuracy of the line-based perturbation method via the introduction of the perturbation corrections. We effectively construct the first and the second order corrections. We also perform the error analysis to predict that the introduction of successive corrections substantially enhances the order of the method from four, for the zeroth order version, to six and ten when the first and the second-order corrections are included. In order to remove the effect of the accuracy loss due to near-cancellation of like-terms when evaluating the perturbation corrections we construct alternative asymptotic formulae using a Maple code. We also propose a procedure for choosing the step size in terms of the preset accuracy and give a number of numerical illustrations. After a short survey over the efforts in the direction of solving the Schr\"odinger equation by using piecewise approximations of the potential function, the paper focuses on the piecewise perturbation methods in their CP implementation.

We choose the eigenvalues of the Kratzer oscillator as experimental data to test both the performance of the method and the accuracy of the Dunham expansion about equilibrium. The Dunham expansion obtained from the spectrum has a range of utility which is remarkably larger than the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion about equilibrium. We also apply the present method to the ground electronic state of the CO molecule and show that the Dunham expansion agrees with the RKR turning points. We discuss further applications of the method. A method is proposed for obtaining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation. The eigenvalue problem is transformed into a system of two first-order ordinary linear differential equations. The propagation matrix for the solution is written as the exponential of a traceless matrix which is then approximated by the Magnus expansion. The bound-state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by requiring that the latter satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. The Morse potential is considered as an illustrative example. A new four-step exponentially-fitted method is developed in this paper. The expressions for the coefficients of the method are found such as to ensure the optimal approximation to the eigenvalue Schr\"odinger equation (i.e., equivalent to positive energy). In this paper, we focus our attention on deriving and analyzing an efficient energy-preserving formula for the system of nonlinear oscillatory or highly oscillatory second-order differential equations q{${''}$}(t)+Mq(t)=fq(t){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mo is="true"{$>{''}<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}+{$<$}/mo{$><$}mi mathvariant="italic" is="true"{$>$}Mq{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}f{$<$}/mi{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close=")" open="(" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}t{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, where M is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix with M{$\gg$}1{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\gg<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} and f(q)=-{$\nabla$}qU(q){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}f{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}-{$<$}/mo{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\nabla<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} is the negative gradient of a real-valued function U(q){$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}U{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}({$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mo stretchy="false" is="true"{$>$}){$<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}.

The energy-preserving formula exactly preserves the Hamiltonian. We analyze in detail the properties of the energy-preserving formula and propose new efficient energy-preserving integrators in the sense of numerical implementation. The convergence analysis of the fixed-point iteration is presented for the implicit integrators proposed in this paper. It is shown that the convergence of implicit Average Vector Field methods is dependent on M{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}, whereas the convergence of the new energy-preserving integrators is independent of M{$<$}math{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mfenced close="{$\Vert$}" open="{$\Vert$}" is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}M{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mfenced{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}. The Fermi\textendash Pasta\textendash Ulam problem and the sine\textendash Gordon equation are carried out numerically to show the competence and efficiency of the novel integrators in comparison with the well-known Average Vector Field methods in the scientific literature. The energy preserving average vector field (AVF) integrator is applied to evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) in bi-Hamiltonian form with nonconstant Poisson structures. Numerical results for the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation and for the Ito type coupled KdV equation confirm the long term preservation of the Hamiltonians and Casimir integrals, which is essential in simulating waves and solitons. Dispersive properties of the AVF integrator are investigated for the linearized equations to examine the nonlinear dynamics after discretization. This paper presents the underlying theory, associated mathematical modelling and analysis of a sponge-layer damping technique, termed the Time-Reversal-Sponge-Layer (TRSL), that significantly improves the performance of aeroacoustic Time-Reversal (TR). The TR technique requires the use of multiple Line Arrays (LAs) in a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM) to accurately predict the source location and its characteristics. However, it is shown that when using multiple LAs, the interference between the opposite propagating fluxes near the LA boundaries results in the formation of spurious local maxima regions throughout the computational domain, thereby reducing the capacity of TR to resolve acoustic sources. The novel TRSL technique proposed in this work minimises this unwanted interference by damping the flux normally incident on a LA boundary and is implemented using the Pseudo-Characteristic Formulation (PCF) of the two-dimensional Linearised Euler Equations (LEE). The performance of TRSL is assessed by simulating a number of test cases such as an idealised time-harmonic monopole, dipole and lateral quadrupole sources as well as multiple (two) dipole sources of different strengths located in a nonuniform mean shear flow. The use of TRSL suppresses the formation of spurious maxima and significantly improves the source map, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of this damping technique. The performance of TRSL is compared with two other methods: a TR superposition technique and Conventional Beamforming (CB). The TR superposition technique prevents the flux interference problem near the LA boundaries by superposing the instantaneous time-reversed acoustic pressure fields computed from individual LAs. The source map obtained using the superposition technique was found to be identical to that obtained using the TRSL damping technique, however, the computational cost was much higher. A comparison with CB indicated that although CB accurately predicts the aeroacoustic source location, the relative magnitudes of the side-lobes in the CB source map(s) are substantially higher in comparison to the corresponding TR source map(s). It was also shown that TR with use of the TRSL is better suited for resolving multiple coherent sources in a domain than the CB method, especially when one source is much weaker than other sources in the domain. We report some special solutions of biconfluent Heun equation and triconfluent Heun equation via extended Nikiforov\textendash Uvarov (NU) method which is developed by changing the boundary conditions of NU method [8]. We demonstrate that eigenvalue solutions of these confluent forms of Heun equation can be achieved exactly. Furthermore we give eigenvalue solution of a two-electron quantum dot model problem as a physical application of extended NU method. In this paper, we consider a class of coupled systems of PDEs, denoted by (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}. For each {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, the system (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} consists of an Allen\textendash Cahn type equation in a bounded spacial domain {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, and another Allen\textendash Cahn type equation on the smooth boundary {$\Gamma$}:={$\partial\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Gamma<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}:{$<$}/mo{$><$}mo is="true"{$>$}={$<$}/mo{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\partial<$}/mi{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}, and besides, these coupled equations are transmitted via the dynamic boundary conditions. In particular, the equation in {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} is derived from the non-smooth energy proposed by Visintin in his monography ``Models of phase transitions'': hence, the diffusion in {$\Omega<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\Omega<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} is provided by a quasilinear form with singularity. The objective of this paper is to build a mathematical method to obtain meaningful L2{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}L{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}-based solutions to our systems, and to see some robustness of (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} with respect to {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}. On this basis, we will prove two Main Theorems 1 and 2, which will be concerned with the well-posedness of (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for each {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, and the continuous dependence of solutions to (ACE){$\epsilon<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} for the variations of {$\epsilon\geq$}0{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\epsilon<$}/mi{$><$}mo is="true"{$>\geq<$}/mo{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}0{$<$}/mn{$><$}/math{$>$}, respectively. American put option pricing under regime switching is modelled by a system of coupled partial differential equations. The proposed model combines better the reality of the market by incorporating the regime switching jointly with the emotional behaviour of traders using the rationality parameter approach recently introduced by T\aa gholt Gad and Lund Petersen to cope with possible irrational exercise policy. The classical rational exercise is recovered as a limit case of the rational parameter. The resulting nonlinear system of PDEs is solved by a weighted finite difference method, also known as \texttheta{$<$}math{$><$}mi is="true"{$>\theta <$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-method. In order to avoid the need of an iterative method for nonlinear system, the term with rationality parameter and the coupling term are treated explicitly. Next, the resulting linear system is solved by Thomas algorithm. Stability conditions for the numerical scheme are studied by using von Neumann approach. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The computation of eigenvalues of regular Sturm-Liouville problems is considered. It is shown that a simple step-dependent linear multistep method can be used to reduce the error of the orderk4h2 of the centered finite difference estimate of thek-th eigenvalue with uniform step lengthh, to an error of orderkh2. By an appropriate minimization of the local error term of the method one can obtain even more accurate results. A comparison of the simple correction techniques of Paine, de Hoog and Anderssen and of Andrew and Paine is given. Numerical examples demonstrate the usefulness of this correction even for low values ofk.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new kind of discretization scheme for solving a two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. The scheme uses a symmetrical multi-point difference formula to represent the partial differentials of the two-dimensional variables, which can improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions to the order of {$\Delta$}x2Nq+2 when a (2Nq+1)-point formula is used for any positive integer Nq with {$\Delta$}x={$\Delta$}y, while Nq=1 equivalent to the traditional scheme. On the other hand, the new scheme keeps the same form of the traditional matrix equation so that the standard algebraic eigenvalue algorithm with a real, symmetric, large sparse matrix is still applicable. Therefore, for the same dimension, only a little more CPU time than the traditional one should be used for diagonalizing the matrix. The numerical examples of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the two-dimensional Henon\textendash Heiles potential demonstrate that by using the new method, the error in the numerical solutions can be reduced steadily and extensively through the increase of Nq, which is more efficient than the traditional methods through the decrease of the step size.},
