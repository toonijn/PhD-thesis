  abstract = {In this paper, we present the basic routines of the C++-program Matslise 3.0, an updated but yet restricted version of the matlab package Matslise 2.0. Matslise 3.0 currently allows the accurate, but in comparison to Matslise 2.0, faster computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of one dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger problems. The numerical examples show that speed up factors up to 20 (for the eigenvalues) and 200 (for the eigenfunctions) are obtained. These highly optimized routines will enable us, in the near future, to extend Matslise 3.0 to solve time-independent 2D and 3D as well as time-dependent 1D problems. Program summary Program Title: Matslise 3.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://dx.doi.org/10.17632/4yn7pp92y4.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/twist-numerical/matslise Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/2123682/tree/v1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: C++, Python Nature of problem: The time-independent one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is an ordinary differential equation with highly oscillatory solutions. This program calculates the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a given potential accurately and efficiently. Solution method: A constant-perturbation method is used. In this method a piecewise constant approximation of the potential is improved by adding perturbation terms. To locate the eigenvalues multiple shooting is employed. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The code submitted also contains routines to solve the two-dimensional time-independent Schr\"odinger equation. This extra code will be described in a later article.},

  abstract = {The method consists in a flexible transformation of the 2D problem into a set of 1D single and coupled channel problems. This set of problems is then solved numerically by some highly tuned codes. By choosing codes based on CP methods and formulating an ad-hoc shooting procedure for the localization of the eigenenergies we obtain a version which is very efficient for speed and memory requirements. Extension of the method to more dimensions is also possible.},
